## Creating Your Own Posts

This post uses **frontmatter** (YAML metadata at the top) for better organization:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-03-15"  # ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "A brief description of your post"
---
```

**Supported date formats:**
- ISO: `2024-03-15`
- US: `March 15, 2024`
- EU: `15/03/2024`
- US short: `03/15/2024`

The blog system also supports **legacy format** (date in italics: `*March 15, 2024*`) for backwards compatibility.
