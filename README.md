## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd jupyter-book-blog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update content and metadata**
   ```bash
   python scripts/update_toc.py        # Update table of contents
   python scripts/generate_posts.py    # Update homepage
   ```

4. **Build and serve locally**
   ```bash
   jupyter-book build .
   cd _build/html && python -m http.server 8000
   ```

5. **Visit your site**: `http://localhost:8000`

### Adding New Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `book/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with date in this format: `*March 15, 2024*`
3. Run the update scripts:
   ```bash
   python scripts/update_toc.py
   python scripts/generate_posts.py
   ```
4. Rebuild: `jupyter-book build .`

The homepage and navigation will be updated automatically!

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:

1. Updates table of contents and homepage
2. Builds the Jupyter Book
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

Simply push to the `main` branch and your site updates automatically.

### Manual Deployment

For other platforms, build locally and deploy the `_build/html` directory.

## Customization

### Configuration

Edit `_config.yml` to customize:
- Site title and author
- Theme colors and styling
- Repository links
- Analytics integration

### Styling

- Add custom CSS in `_static/` directory
- Modify HTML templates
- Customize Mermaid diagram styling

### Content Organization

- Organize posts in the `book/` directory
- Add images to `images/` with subdirectories
- Use the `examples/` directory for reference content

## Why This Approach?

Traditional blogging platforms often limit technical content creators. Jupyter Book provides:

- **Academic-Quality Typesetting** - Professional mathematical and scientific notation
- **Developer-Friendly Workflow** - Git-based, markdown-driven content creation
- **Extensible Architecture** - Full control over features and functionality
- **Performance Optimized** - Fast static sites with modern web standards
- **Future-Proof** - Open source with active development community

Perfect for researchers, data scientists, developers, and anyone who needs to combine narrative content with technical visualizations.
